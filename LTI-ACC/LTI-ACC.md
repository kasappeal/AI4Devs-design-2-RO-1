## High level design

### System Overview

The "ATS of the Future" is a scalable, modular, and AI-enhanced recruitment platform. It optimizes the hiring lifecycle with intelligent automation, real-time collaboration, and seamless integration with external HR systems.

### High-Level Components

#### 1. User Interfaces
- **Admin Panel** – Manage job postings, workflows, users, and analytics.
- **Recruiter Dashboard** – Resume review, scheduling, communication.
- **Candidate Portal** – Application tracking, messaging, interview prep.
- **Collaboration Workspace** – Real-time team discussions, notes.

#### 2. Core Services
- **Job Management Service** – Job creation, approval, and multichannel publishing.
- **Application Workflow Service** – Custom stages, status tracking.
- **Resume Parsing & Profile Engine** – Structured data extraction and profile creation.
- **Interview Management** – Scheduler, calendar integration, reminders.
- **Communication Service** – Messaging, templates, notifications.
- **Compliance Engine** – EEOC, GDPR, audit logs.

#### 3. AI & Automation Layer
- **AI Resume Screener** – NLP-based filtering and matching.
- **Intelligent Workflow Engine** – Automates tasks using hiring pattern insights.
- **Predictive Analytics Engine** – Forecasts time-to-hire, candidate success.
  
#### 4. Integration Layer
- **API Gateway** – Unified interface for external/internal services.
- **Integration Connectors** – HRIS, payroll, onboarding, calendar systems.

#### 5. Data & Analytics
- **Data Lake & Warehouse** – Structured and unstructured data storage.
- **Analytics Dashboard** – Visualizations, insights for recruiters and leadership.

### Data Flow Summary

1. **Job Posting:** Admin creates a job → distributed via job boards/APIs.
2. **Application Intake:** Candidate applies → resume parsed → profile created.
3. **AI Screening:** AI engine ranks candidates → sends to recruiters.
4. **Collaboration:** Recruiters discuss in workspace → schedule interviews.
5. **Automation:** Intelligent workflows send reminders, update statuses.
6. **Selection:** Final candidate moves to offer → HR systems notified via integration.

## C4 Diagram of Data & Analytics System Component

### Level 1: System Context Diagram 

```mermaid
graph TD
  User[Recruiter / Hiring Manager]
  ATS[ATS of the Future]
  DA[Data & Analytics System]
  HRIS[HRIS / Payroll System]
  
  User --> ATS
  ATS --> DA
  DA --> HRIS
  HRIS --> DA
```

**Explanation:**

* Users interact with the ATS, which relies on the Data & Analytics system for insights.
* The Data & Analytics system pulls relevant data from HRIS systems (e.g., onboarding or turnover rates) for enhanced reporting.

### Level 2: Container Diagram

    ML["ML Model Store & Pipeline"]
  end

  DL --> PIPE

```

**Explanation:**

* **Data Lake** stores raw logs, events, resumes, and application data.
* **Data Pipeline** transforms raw data into structured datasets for analysis and ML training.
* **ML Models** generate insights (e.g., time-to-hire prediction) and feed structured outcomes into the Data Warehouse.
* **Analytics Service** exposes APIs to the Dashboard UI for recruiter consumption.

  DASH --> QueryAPI
  QueryAPI --> ReportGen

```

**Explanation:**

* **Query Engine** receives dashboard queries
* **Report Generator** builds standard and ad-hoc reports from warehouse data
* **Insight Engine** runs ML-inferred analytics like candidate success prediction
* **Access Control** ensures recruiters and admins access only authorized datasets
